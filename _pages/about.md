My name is Zhaowei Zhang, my friends also call me Vivian. 

I was born in Canton, China, (a.k.a the city of flower), and moved to Canada when I was 18. Recently graduated from McGill University with a master in electrical engineering and a 3.8 GPA, I hope to bridge the gap between business and technology by providing effective solutions to business problems as a data scientist. 

As a former member of the [McGill Computer Networks Research Lab](http://networks.ece.mcgill.ca), I was supervised by [Prof. Mark Coates](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/) and my graduate research mainly revolves around deep learning on graphs and its applications in recommender systems, which is all about analyzing user behavior data and predicting their preferences. 

Outside of my research, I also enjoyed learning everything I could about data analysis, visualization, and their applications in the tech industry.
